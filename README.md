Within this README I will be answering questions from the journel entry guidelines.


How do I write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
What were the advantages of working in this way? How else could I use this CRUD Python module in the future?

As of this moment in my learning journey, my code written is very simple and beginner. I do not write more then the base of the project code due to a lower level of understanding.
The current works in my favor, due to it allowing my code to be simple thus resulting is a easier read from other developers reviewing it. 

I could use this CRUD module to review in the future to remind my of the simple non-SQL methods I learned for future data projects.



How do I pproach a problem as a computer scientist? 
How did my approach to this project differ from previous assignments in other courses?
What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to create databases to meet other client requests?

I first approach with the base of the code given to me, then dissect each item that is need after in order to finish. Sort of like a mini team meeting with myself. 
This allows to review how to create what is need and after focus on the little details to add.

I believe this will help with future clients, because this would mimic the base of an actual project such as if a client. 
This could be similar to a project such as making a bank app base and then details of what the graphic image of the app would be after.



What do computer scientists do, and why does it matter?

Computer scientists I believe create the base bones to many projects. 
Computer sciences not only need to develop systems but understand how to in many different ways to build the programs, make them run quicker, and to re-update later. 
They must know everything to create and make their creation keep improving. 
Technology will always be growing and advancing. We must not only learn, but ride a wave of continuing growing of learning as time goes.



How would my work on this type of project help a company, like Grazioso Salvare, to do their work better?

I do not believe I could do their work better.
My work would have been much better if I learned a few details before my class. 
I felt a had many challanges within this term.

However, This I believe with me something I would have for future projects. 
I will gain many challanges in future projects and this will help with my end of the learning side of my coding journey.
